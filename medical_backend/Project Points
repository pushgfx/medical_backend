Edge TPU for Real-Time Inferences

Benefits:

+ Faster inference times compared to GPU or bare CPU
+ low cost

Cons:

- lower throughput compared to GPU
- poorer energy proportionality


Project Goal:

+ To evaluate the cost effectiveness of low power TPU acceleration on edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi 3.
+ Compare the cost to making inferences with cloud resources where latency is less of an issue.
+ Understand the applications that benefit the most from TPU acceleration.
